# Js-week3review

When complete, this program will create a forum for users to ask medical questions that are important enough to talk about but not important enough to see a real doctor about. 

##Known Bugs

The Edit Question function throws "cannot read property 'set' of undefined", even though I think I have defined "question".
The Answer Question button saves information to the database, but doesn't link the answer to a question, which means the answers don't show on the question page.
